                <p>
                    The Great White Shark, the shark most humans fear do to its notable representation in the JAWS
                    movies. The Great White Shark belongs to a species of shark known as the mackerel shark. Of the
                    species of Great White Shark the females are larger than their male counterparts growing to around
                    20 feet in length. The lifespan of the Great White is estimated to be around 70 years or more.

                <h2>Top Predator?</h2>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief Great White Sharks are not the "top predator" of the ocean. That title
                    goes to the Orca. Orcas are known to feed on Great Whites and many others types of shark. </p>
