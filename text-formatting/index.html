    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p> <em><q>Fear is a prison. But when you combine it with secrets, it becomes especially toxic, vicious. It puts us all into solitary, unable to hear one another clearly.</q> Jim Butcher</em>  says about Peace Talks. 

    </p>
    <p> <strong>Peace Talks</strong>  is a return to form for <em>Jim Butcher</em> . The stakes could not be higher for our lovable rogue wizard Harry Dresden. Just as he is starting to get his feet back on a solid foundation the world throws him some of the biggest curve balls yet. The tension and mystery in this book have been some of the best in the series keeping the read guessing and asking questions the whole way through.
